(Taken from #cfs??????)
Here are the guidelines on how to survive the Seminar, focusing on formatting and presentation. The contents? It's up to the requirements that the lecturer wants to 

# Chapter 1. Word Report

For Word, based on the lecturer's requirement, please do the format that follows them. If there is no requirement for any subject, my recommendation is as follows:

Step 1: Format the following headings/font styles so that when we create files, we don't have to worry about Heading (Kinda... We rarely use Heading 4):
+ Heading 1: 16, Bold, Line Spacing 1.5, Before 12, After 0 (Or every 6pt, then go sleep :zzz: )
+ Heading 2: 13, Bold, Line Spacing 1.5, Before 6, After 6
+ Heading 3: 13, Bold Italic, Line Spacing 1.5, Before 6, After 6
+ Heading 4: 13, Italic, Line Spacing 1.5, Before 6, After 6
+ Normal: 13, Line spacing 1.5, Before 6, After 6
⚠ Please note that the general format is Times New Roman font, Justify alignment!!
ⓘ Instructions: On the Home tab, see the Normal, Heading 1, and some kind of <censored> right in the Style section? Click on the button that has the shape like ↧, then right-click on the Style you need (Normal and 4 Headings like I said above), select Modify, then edit as above
Step 2: You may wonder, why did I tell you to do the first step, is it a waste of time to do so? Lemme ask you something, you guys want to do number automatically, and you want to do the Headings without wasting time, right? Typing 1.1., 2.1., 3.1., then 1.2.1., 2.3.4.1., then format every section of text that is "Heading", it surely wastes a lot of time, I bet you guys kinda want to take more time on exam and play some games like Limbus or osu! or some others. If so, hear me out, you only need to do this once, the next time you just need to select it and it will automatically number the headings.
+ In Paragraph section, go for Multilevel List/Multilevel List
+ Click on it then choose according to some templates you want, or, you can define a new Multilevel list for yourself!
+ While defining, remember to click More, and link the numbering of the headings that matches the correct Heading! My recommendation should be:
- Heading 1: Chapter 1. (Can Caps Lock all on Heading 1)
- Heading 2: 1.1.
- Heading 3: 1.1.1.
- Heading 4: 1.1.1.1.

+ When you're done, just click on Multilevel List, choose the type of list you want -> Done
(Note: If you do it on Google Drive, you can type 1.1. manually, it's okay, but if you want to do it like me, I recommend you do it all on Drive (without numbering), set the sections of text you wanna make it as Heading, download it, then format it)

Step 3: If you do the above 2 steps successfully, you'll see, when you create a new Heading, it will automatically number. And so, you are rest assured to do the Table of Contents!

# Chapter 2: PowerPoint
## 2.1. About the presentation file

About the PowerPoint file, I will take contents from my comment to share:

+ If there is no slide limit and time limit from 30 minutes -> 2 hours, **please go wild**, I often experiment with a large number of slides
+ The lecturer may ask you to clearly present all the data in the report, so just include it if you need it
+ PowerPoint style: It will depend on the subject, some subjects require the more prominent, the more attractive, the better, choosing a theme for a subject is a unique story. I agree that maybe, uhm, I should choose a single theme, but you also need to rely on the context to choose the color of the theme. For example: Fire and explosion incidents like in the picture, make it red for hot, or chemical spills theme id yellow (since yellow is common in chemistry, maybe?), construction theme is grey, etc... 
+ Fonts should be creative, as long as the audience can read them, good for ya. And be aware whoever is doing a presentation this time with a font size of 20 - 22 on the slide, be careful, the teacher will not go easy on you, you have to know how to sympathize with the people sitting behind, boi. Are ya a nerd that really wants to "penetrate" people with bad eyesight?
So what I mean here is that, the slide must have a font size of 28 for easy reading, minimum 24 if a lot of data needs to be shown in 1 slide.
+ The chosen theme must stand out and convey the content (as above). I encourage ya to add images, because while presenting, you will need it later! :wink:

## 2.2. Presenter
I bet that every 2nd and 3rd year student has presented at least once. For 1st year students or those in grades 11 and 12 who have done group projects, you already have certain presentation skills. However, in certain subjects, you will also be the presenter, so, as I said in the comment of a confession, "What is the most important thing? Your presentation skills. This one has 128 slides, and I just finished it in 17 minutes, and set the results. I'm sure there are not few students who have to hold the mic and look at the slides all the time and read the slides, even when the number of slides is under 20 - 30. So, special subjects like this one that require presentation skills but just reading the slides, not looking at the audience is a huge disadvantage for ya". Therefore, if you do not have the skills of presentation, here are some skills that I have collected after going through many presentations, and after competing in the Science and Technology Festival:

1. The voice must be loud and clear: Everyone, including me and you, wants to hear good sound smoothly, but clear, full HD, 1080p. But then, you (as presenter) cannot do that, is it difficult for the audience and contradicts what you want? If your voice is loud, go ahead, if your voice is small, I suggest you to hold the mic, so people will hear you clearly

2. Briefly, concisely state the main idea, explain that idea when needed. This is a way for you to be able to skim unnecessary slides, saving time and making it easier for the listener. I heard someone say that the attention time of the young generation is not high, even me after 10 minutes of listening to a group presentation that is not outstanding has to stray away to do something else, so, skim whatever you can!

3. Eye contact time during the presentation must be > 40%. Yep, you ain't hear wrong. That is, every 5 seconds you look at the slide, then you must turn around and talk to the audience for 10 - 15 seconds, and look at them, confidently, just like when you talk to your friends! I don't force you to not look at the slide all the time, I do too since my memory is not that good, but you have to look at the audience while presenting. Bluntly saying, when you talk to your friend but you turn your back, don't look at their face while talking, is it a bit... Rude? :v

4. Use the body language. Your hands will help you do that. At least you should try to use your hands to point to the content, or make gestures to simulate the information you need to inform. Let me see, "growth/raise in sth" -> Raise your hands up slowly, like that

5. Interact with the audience. Yep, this is another key to succeed the presentation. Probably very few people use this method, usually teachers, but I have learned and applied it, it's quite effective. At some point, maybe you can try to ask audience: "All gud?"/"Y'all got what I said?", and then from time to time, you can give direct examples from your classmates, for example: "Now I'm going to tell you about a work accident. *Points to somewhere* Oh, this guy is in accident! Someone needs to rescue this guy, quick! So, what will y'all do??'

6. Encourage using objects as gifts, or to illustrate what you want to say. For example, if my article is about Nike, I will buy a Nike shoe keychain. Yup, everyone likes gift, ain't it?

7. Try to bow and say thank you at the start and end of presentation. Greet people that you meet, then try to do the it during the presentation too. Why? It's a way to show my respect for the audience!

(Optional) Adding a presentation pen is a MASSIVE advantage, please take care and try to use it effectively!!
